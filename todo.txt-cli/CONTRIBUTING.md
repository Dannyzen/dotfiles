# DO NOT ENTER AN ISSUE UNTIL IT'S BEEN VERIFIED

Please do not enter feature requests or bug reports here until you have joined the mailing list and submitted it there for verification and discussion first.

Then, include a link to the mailing list discussion once the issue has been verified as something that needs to be fixed/added to the core script (and not an add-on or otherwise). Thanks!
