Hey there, I'm [Danny] (http://www.dannyrosen.net). I'm a Product Guy @ Pivotal Cloud Foundry and these are my [dotfiles] (http://dotfiles.github.com/).


I'm using:

* [travis-ci] (https://travis-ci.org/Dannyzen/dotfiles) - for making sure my .zshrc has a clean stderr (it does, but travis doesn't realize.)
* [Antigen] (https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) - For pulling down the things for my zsh

* [homesick] (https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) - for bringing down the dotfiles

*	[vundle] (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) - for managing my vim plugins

*	[oh-my-zsh] (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - for extending my zsh 

* [ack-grep] (http://beyondgrep.com/) - for going above and beyond grep

* [todo.txt] (http://todotxt.com/) - for todos
